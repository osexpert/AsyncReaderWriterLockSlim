# AsyncReaderWriterLockSlim

This is an alternative to .NET's
[`ReaderWriterLockSlim`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim)
with a similar functionality, but can be used in async methods. Due to its async-readiness, it
does **not support recursive locks** (see section [Differences](#differences-to-readerwriterlockslim)).

## Lock Modes

The lock can have different modes:
 * **Read mode:** One or more *read mode* locks can be active at a time while no *write mode* lock
   is active.
 * **Write mode:** One *write mode* lock can be active at a time while no other
   *write mode* locks and no other *read mode* locks are active.

When a task or thread ("execution flow") tries to enter a *write mode* lock while at least one
*read mode* lock is active, it is blocked until the last *read mode* lock is released.

When a task or thread tries to enter a *read mode* lock while a *write mode* lock is active,
it is blocked until the *write mode* lock is released.

If, while other *read mode* locks are active and the current task or thread waits to enter
the *write mode* lock, another task or thread tries
to enter a *read mode* lock, it is blocked until
the current task or thread released the *write mode* lock (or canceled the wait operation), 
which means writers are favored in this case.

Also, when a *write mode* lock is released while there are one or more execution flows
trying to enter a *write mode* lock and also one or more execution flows trying to enter a
*read mode* lock, writers are favored.


## Lock Methods

The lock provides synchronous `Enter...()` methods for the different lock modes that block
until the lock has been acquired, and asynchronous `Enter...Async()` methods that
"block asynchronously" by returning a
[`Task`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task) that
will complete once the lock has been acquired. 

For each `Enter...()` and `Enter...Async()` method there is also a `TryEnter...()` and
`TryEnter...Async()` method that allow you to specify an integer time-out, and return a `Boolean` 
that indicates if the lock could be acquired within that time-out.

You must make sure to call the corresponding `Exit...()` method to release the lock once you
don't need it anymore.

Additionally, the `AsyncReaderWriterLockSlimExtension` class contains extension methods
that return an `IDisposable` so that the lock can be used with a `using` block.


## Performance Considerations

When using the `AsyncReaderWriterLockSlim` for *write mode* locks only, performance is
significantly slower than simply using a
[`SemaphoreSlim`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.semaphoreslim)
due to the additional overhead. Therefore, use the `AsyncReaderWriterLockSlim` only
when there are far more readers than writers.


## Differences to ReaderWriterLockSlim

This implementation has the following differences to .NET's
[`ReaderWriterLockSlim`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim):

 * The lock is not thread-affine, which means one thread can enter the lock, and a different
   thread can release it. This allows you to use the lock in an async method with a `await`
   operator between entering and releasing the lock.
 * Additionally to synchronous methods like `EnterReadLock`, it has asynchronous methods
   like `EnterReadLockAsync` which can be called in async methods, so that the current thread
   is not blocked while waiting for the lock.
 * You can specify a 
   [`CancellationToken`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken)
   when entering a lock to cancel the wait operation.
 * Because this lock is not thread-affine, **recursive locks are not supported** (which
   also means they cannot be detected). In order for the lock to work correctly, you must not
   recursively enter the lock from the same execution flow.
 * The lock does not support upgradeable read mode locks that can be upgraded to a write mode
   lock, due to the complexity this would add.


## Differences to Nito.AsyncEx.AsyncReaderWriterLock

This implementation has the following differences to Nito.AsyncEx'
[`AsyncReaderWriterLock`](https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx/blob/master/src/Nito.AsyncEx.Coordination/AsyncReaderWriterLock.cs):

  * Instead of methods that return an `IDisposable`, it has `Enter...()` and `Exit...()` methods
    similar to .NET's `ReaderWriterLockSlim`. However, the class `AsyncReaderWriterLockSlimExtension`
	provides extension methods that return an `IDisposable`.
  * Additionally to providing a `CancellationToken` that allows you to cancel the wait operation,
    you can supply an integer time-out to the `TryEnter...()` methods.
  * When calling one of the `Enter...()` methods with an already canceled
    [`CancellationToken`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken),
    the method does not try to acquire the lock, but instead throws a `OperationCanceledException`,
	which matches the behavior of `SemaphoreSlim`. <br>
	To try to acquire the lock without blocking, you can call one of the `Try...` methods without
	specifying a timeout (or specify a timeout of `0`).
  * You can downgrade a *write mode* lock to a *read mode* lock by calling
    `DowngradeWriteLockToReadLock()`.
  * Non-async methods do not require a ThreadPool thread to run the unblock logic; instead all
    code is executed in the thread that called the synchronous method.<br>
	This means e.g. synchronous methods can still work even
	when the ThreadPool (used for async task continuations) is currently exhausted,
	but only if you didn't call async methods at the same time that are still waiting to get the lock.
  * The lock is not *fair* ([just as the underlying `SemaphoreSlim`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/13584)),
    which means there is no guarantee in which order threads will acquire the lock (e.g. if
    multiple threads want to get a write lock at the same time using synchronous methods).<br>
	Fairness can actually lead to problems like lock convoys, and shouldn't be needed in most cases.


## Additional Infos

Note: The supported maximum number of concurrent locks in **read mode** is limited to `int.MaxValue` (2147483647).

The lock internally uses
[`SemaphoreSlim`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.semaphoreslim)
to implement wait functionality.

## Examples

Enter the lock in read mode within an async method:

```c#
private async Task TestReadModeAsync(AsyncReaderWriterLockSlim asyncLock)
{
    // Asynchronously enter the lock in read mode. The task completes after the lock
    // has been acquired.
    await asyncLock.EnterReadLockAsync();
    try
    {
        // Use Task.Delay to simulate asynchronous work, which means a different thread
        // might continue execution after this point.
        await Task.Delay(200);
    }
    finally
    {
        asyncLock.ExitReadLock();
    }
}
```

Enter the lock in read mode within an async method within an `using` block:

```c#
private async Task TestReadModeAsync(AsyncReaderWriterLockSlim asyncLock)
{
    // Asynchronously enter the lock in read mode. The task completes after the lock
    // has been acquired.
    // As the Get...() methods return a IDisposeable, you can use the lock within an
    // "using" block.
    using (var myLock = await asyncLock.GetReadLockAsync())
    {
        // Use Task.Delay to simulate asynchronous work, which means a different thread
        // might continue execution after this point.
        await Task.Delay(200);
    }
}
```

Enter the lock in write mode in a synchronous method, using a timeout:

```c#
private void TestWriteMode(AsyncReaderWriterLockSlim asyncLock)
{
    // Try to enter the lock within 2 seconds.
    if (asyncLock.TryEnterWriteLock(2000))
    {
        try
        {
            // Simulate some work...
            Thread.Sleep(200);
        }
        finally
        {
            asyncLock.ExitWriteLock();
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // We could not enter the lock within the timeout...
    }
}
```
